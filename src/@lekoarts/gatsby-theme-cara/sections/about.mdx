## About DOMO

All social networks these days have nearly the same features, just different layouts. While many decentralized, open source social networks offer similar functions, there is unfortunately no rush. Everyone use a different social network, privacy and data protection plays a secondary role.

## Starting with the Community

Instead of releasing a new social network that would most likely hardly be used, we focus on developing a educated community across all existing social networks.
